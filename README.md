# SignalR Chat Prototype

A simple ASP.NET SignalR chat prototype for reference.

This chat prototype was written in C# and uses the SignalR JavaScript
client. This prototype was created simply to be used as a reference to 
implement SignalR or chat projects in a similar environment. 

Checkout my `socket.io` implementation of the chat prototype for an apples to
apples comparison.
